# Reproducible Data Science

Session materials for the 2019 DRIVE/ conference: https://www.case.org/event/drive19.html

Have you spent hours aggregating data, creating visualizations and writing up takeaways only to have to start over when changes are needed? Or wanted to update a project and been stymied by a lack of documentation? There is a better way! Learn how reproducible research methods and tools like Git and Markdown can help your team spend more time answering questions and less time on busywork. This session includes a demo in RStudio and reviews the tools needed to get started.
